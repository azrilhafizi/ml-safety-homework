## Hazard Analysis

### Problem 1
A separate model using for understanding reliability is the “Nines of Reliability.” An event with a success probability p will have k nines of reliability, where k is defined as $$k = -\log_{10}(1 - p)$$ Hence, if $p=90\%, k=1.0$, $p=99\%, k=2.0$, $p=99.9\%, k=3.0$. 

A logarithmic scale spaces out distinct levels of reliability more properly. A 1% improvement is more useful the closer to 100%. In terms of nines of reliability, how large is a “mere” 1% improvement from 98% → 99% compared to 50% → 51%? How many nines of reliability does p = 100% correspond to? Imagine someone proposes converting all risk measurements into this format; what would be a limitation of this approach?

### Problem 1 Solution
1% improvement from 98% to 99%:
- $p_1 = 98\%$, corresponds to $k_1 = - \log_{10}(1 - 0.98) \approx 2.0$ nines
- $p_2 = 99\%$, corresponds to $k_2 = - \log_{10}(1 - 0.99) \approx 2.0$ nines as well

1% improvement from 50% to 51%:
- $p_3 = 50\%$, corresponds to $k_3 = - \log_{10}(1 - 0.5) = 0.0$ nines
- $p_4 = 51\%$, corresponds to $k_4 = - \log_{10}(1 - 0.51) \approx 0.3$ nines
- The same 1% improvement results in a larger increase in nines when starting from a lower reliability

Reliability of 100%:
- When $p = 100\%$, the formula becomes $k = - \log_{10}(0)$, which is undefined
- So, technically, it doesn't have a defined value in this format

Limitation of the approach:
- The approach is highly sensitive to small changes in high-reliability scenarios but less sensitive in low-reliability situations.
- It assumes a perfect correlation between the probability of success and the reliability, which might not always hold true in complex systems.

### Problem 2
Someone says “first we must quantify the risk more precisely before taking further action.” Discuss weaknesses of this proposed strategy.

### Problem 2 Solution
The proposed strategy carries several weaknesses. The first one is the time-intensive nature of data collection and analysis may hinder timely decision-making, particularly in urgent scenarios. Additionally, the assumption that all relevant factors can be accurately measured overlooks the unpredictable elements within complex and dynamic systems. Also, relying solely on quantification may lead to a false sense of security, as numbers might not fully capture the uncertainties and unknowns associated with certain risks.

### Problem 3
Say land ownership follows a 80/20 Pareto distribution ($\alpha \approx 1.16$), so 80% of the land is owned by 20% of the people. Roughly how much of the land is owned by the top 1% of land owners? (Hint: $(20\%)^3 \approx 1\%$.)

### Problem 3 Solution

### Problem 4
Suppose the following power law $y = {1 \over 4}x^{-3}$ is plotted on a log-log plot. What would be the plotted line’s slope?

### Problem 4 Solution
Taking the logarithm of both sides: $$\log(y) = \log({1 \over 4}x^{-3})$$

Using logarithm properties, this can be simplified to: $$\log(y) = -3 \log(x) - \log(4)$$

The slope of the line on the log-log plot is the coefficient of $\log(x)$, which is $-3$

### Problem 6
Someone says Black Monday (1987) is a 20 sigma event. What is the probability of an event that is this extreme or more extreme? Does a Gaussian (thin-tailed) assumption seem reasonable, or does a long tailed assumption seem more reasonable for the events witnessed on Black Monday? Someone says Batman’s IQ is 192, and someone says Lex Luthor’s IQ is 225. Assuming the average IQ is 100 with a standard deviation of 15, how many sigma is Batman’s IQ and Luthor’s IQ? What is the probability someone’s IQ is greater than or equal to Batman’s; the probability someone has an IQ greater than or equal to Lex Luthor’s?

### Problem 6 Solution
Black Monday (1987):
- A 20 sigma event is astronomically rare in a Gaussian distribution. The probability of an event being this extreme or more extreme is essentially negligible in a normal distribution. This suggests that a Gaussian (thin-tailed) assumption is not reasonable for describing the events witnessed on Black Monday.

Batman and Lex Luthor's IQ:
```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# IQ scores
batman_iq = 192
luthor_iq = 225

# Mean and standard deviation of IQ scores
mean_iq = 100
std_dev_iq = 15

# Calculate z-scores
z_score_batman = (batman_iq - mean_iq) / std_dev_iq
z_score_luthor = (luthor_iq - mean_iq) / std_dev_iq

print(f"Batman's IQ is {z_score_batman} standard deviations from the mean.")
print(f"Lex Luthor's IQ is {z_score_luthor} standard deviations from the mean.")

# Probability of having IQ greater than or equal to Batman and Lex Luthor
prob_greater_than_batman = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(batman_iq, mean_iq, std_dev_iq)
prob_greater_than_luthor = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(luthor_iq, mean_iq, std_dev_iq)

print(f"The probability of having an IQ greater than or equal to Batman's is {prob_greater_than_batman:.4f}")
print(f"The probability of having an IQ greater than or equal to Lex Luthor's is {prob_greater_than_luthor:.4f}")
```

```
Batman's IQ is 6.13 standard deviations from the mean.
Lex Luthor's IQ is 8.33 standard deviations from the mean.

The probability of having an IQ greater than or equal to Batman's is 0.00
The probability of having an IQ greater than or equal to Lex Luthor's is 0.00
```

### Problem 7
Recall preventive measures help avoid occurrence of unwanted events, and protective measures limit consequences of realized hazardous events. Given two measures, identify which is preventative or protective.

(a) boxing helmet; ice pack (hazard: getting hurt in boxing)

(b) lifeboats on the Titanic; hull of Titanic divided into watertight compartments (Hazard: iceberg)

(c) eating healthy starting from a young age; chemotherapy (hazard: cancer)

(d) teaching a child to want to be honest; getting better at catching a child’s lie (hazard: lies)

### Problem 7 Solution
(a) protective measure

(b) protective measure

(c) preventive measure

(d) preventive measure

### Problem 8
“An ounce of prevention is a pound of cure.” What does this say about the cost efficacy of preventative and protective measures?

### Problem 8 Solution
The saying suggests that investing a small amount in preventive actions can save a significant amount that would otherwise be spent on addressing and mitigating the consequences of a problem or disaster. For instance, in healthcare, promoting healthy lifestyles and preventive care can reduce the occurrence of diseases, ultimately saving on the extensive costs associated with treating illnesses.

### Problem 9
Match these words to the following examples:

- **butterfly effect**: the phenomenon whereby a minute localized change in a complex system can have large effects elsewhere

- **micro-macro dynamics**: a micro-macro dynamic describes a complex interaction between the micro and macro levels to a system

- **positive feedback**: a positive feedback loop is a process where one variable increases the quality of another variable which in turn increases the quantity/occurrence of the first

- **negative feedback**: occurs when some function of the output of a system, process, or mechanism is fed back in a manner that tends to reduce the fluctuations in the output

- **self-organization**: a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system

(a) When a foot wide snowball rolls down a hill, its surface area increases, and therefore the ball collects more and more snow.

(b) Birds flocking and making structured movement patterns.

(c) A software program instructs a computer’s processor to fill its registers, which improves the speed of the software program and allows the software program to change its state.

(d) A waiter got a junior business executive’s breakfast order wrong. The executive still ate the breakfast then went on TV for a live interview. The executive belched loud on TV due to the breakfast not being agreeable with his stomach; this made him a laughing stock at his company and caused him to resign.

(e) A person fears socializing due to not being good at it, so they avoid socializing. This makes them comparatively worse than their peers at socializing. This is increases their fear of socializing even more.

(f) A company gets bad reviews. The company’s hurt reputation leads top employees to leave. This makes the company worse, leading to even worse reviews.

(g) Making rockets cheaper lead to more space travel, which leads to innovation that makes rockets cheaper.

(b) self-organization

(c) micro-macro dynamic

(d) butterfly effect

(e) negative feedback

(f) negative feedback

(g) positive feedback

### Problem 11
Describe a technology that is safe but not reliable. Describe a technology that is reliable but not safe.

### Problem 11 Solution
A technology that is safe but not reliable is backup power generator. This generator might have robust safety mechanisms, shut-off switches, and fail-safes to protect users and prevent hazardous situations. However, it may not be highly reliable in consistently providing power when needed.

On the other hand, a technology that is reliable but not safe could be an industrial machine with a history of consistent performance and minimal downtime. While the machine may reliably perform its intended functions, it might lack sufficient safety features or fail-safes to protect users from potential accidents or injuries.

### Problem 12
“For some definitions of safety, one prevents losses due to unintentional actions by benevolent actors. In security, one prevents losses due to intentional actions by malevolent actors. But the key difference of intent usually does not matter in preventing losses (though differences arise with protective mechanisms).” Argue for or against this statement.

### Problem 12 Solution
I'll argue against the statement. While intent is a fundamental difference between safety and security, it does matter in preventing losses, especially when it comes to designing protective mechanisms. Understanding malicious intent is fundamental in security, where threat assessments, identification of potential attackers, and adaptive countermeasures are essential components. In contrast, safety measures primarily focus on preventing unintentional harm, involving hazard identification and risk reduction strategies. The distinct nature of protective mechanisms in security, such as encryption and intrusion detection, versus safety mechanisms like fail-safes and warnings, underscores the importance of intent.
